# travel

# Objective
Make a coherent 10-day trip through America.

# Rules
You start out with a ten-card rack. Each card represents a state, or a form of transportation. The cards are:

- Place cards. These are states, like Wyoming or California. A state has a location and a color. 
  - Two neighboring states can be placed next to each other on your rack; this is a legal "step".
- Transportation cards. There are two types: planes and cars.
  - Planes allow you to fly from one place to another place. The catch: both places and the plane must be the same color.
  - Cars allow you to travel through a place to get to another place. Cars are colorless.
